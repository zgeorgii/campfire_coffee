      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
      It has been my goal for years to bring the pleasure of the outdoors to people around the world.
      There is nothing more comforting than the twinkle of a starlit sky and the warmth of a campfire by your side.
      Campfire Coffee will bring the outdoors to you, with a cup of wood-fire roasted beans brewed in spring water straight from the mountains.
    There is no better way to being you day.

    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
    <p>
      Here at Campfire Coffee we not only bring the outdoors to you, we do our part to preserve and protect so that generations to come can experience both our coffee and the and the many beauties of the planet which it grows.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start from the ground up with 100% vegan soil and organicly grown coffee beans. Once harvested, the beans are slow roasted over a wood fire, and for every log we use, we plant a tree. Our vacuum sealed packaging is made from 100% recycled plastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only do we take care of our enviroment, we take care of our employees! From farmer to barista, we give fair and livable wages to keep our company happy; because happy people make happy beans!
    </p>
